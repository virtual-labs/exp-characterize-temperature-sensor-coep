**1) RTD is very popular for temperature measurement because of**<br>
[ ] Cost<br>
[ ] Self heating<br>
<b>[x] Linearity<br></b>

**2) In the Pt100, the suffix 100 refers to**<br>
[ ] Resistance at Room Temperature<br>
<b>[x] Resistance at 0 degree C<br></b>
[ ] 100% pure platinum<br>

**3) Commonly used RTD Material is**<br>
<b>[x] Platinum<br></b>
[ ] Aluminium<br>
[ ] Both the above<br>

**4) RTDs are preferred over thermistors because**<br>
<b>[x] RTDs have larger temperature range than thermistors<br></b>
[ ] TDs are more sensitive than thermistors<br>
[ ] RTD's are less sensitive to lead resistance than thermistors<br>

**5) PTC stands for**<br>
[ ] Platinum Temperature Coefficient<br>
[ ] Partial Temperature Coefficient<br>
<b>[x] Positive Temperature Coefficient<br></b>
